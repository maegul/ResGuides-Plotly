# DNA of plot.ly — underlying structure of a plot.ly graph

## Introduction
Behind every plot.ly graph, there is a comprehensive description of every feature of that graph, a "**DNA**" so to speak.  This was addressed briefly in *Fundamental Workings* in the [Python Introduction](./intro.md). 

One of the major strengths of plot.ly is that this "**DNA**" is the same whether you are using plot.ly online, or with matlab, R or javascript.

Here, we will —
1. Learn/Refresh ourselves on lists and dictionaries in python.  Plot.ly's DNA is made up of both of these
2. Learn the structure of plot.ly's DNA.
3. Make a plot entirely by writing a complete description, or "genome" for that plot.
