#Introduction

Three dimensional plots are often overused and redundant.  

**But**, data that is richer than having two dimensions; that has some sort of '*third dimension*', that is meaningful and informative, is quite common.  Here we will use two dimensional plots in a way that brings in that third dimension of data in an effective way.


# Heatmaps

## For what kind of data
Heatmaps are for when you have a full table of data.  That is, when you have a data point for every point along both the x and y axes, and that data point is a value along another third axis.

For instance, lets say you have your own wakefulness for every hour for every day.  Your x axis is the day of the week, your y axis the time of the day, and your third dimension of data is how wakeful you are, on a scale between zero and one.
