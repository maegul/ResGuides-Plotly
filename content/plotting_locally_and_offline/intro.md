# Plotting Locally and Offline

Plot.ly generates web-based interactive visualisations.  In addition to their free online editor and hosting service, the engine that creates the interactive plots can be used offline too.

This engine can be driven any of the four main scripting languages used for data analysis and visualisations:
* Python
* Matlab
* R
* Javascript

For each of these languages, there is a library that provides all of the necessary functions
