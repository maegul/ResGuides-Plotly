# Plotting Locally and Offline

Plot.ly generates web-based interactive visualisations.  In addition to their free online editor and hosting service, the engine that creates the interactive plots can be used offline too.

This engine can be driven by **any** of the four main scripting languages used for data analysis and visualisations:
* [Python](python/intro.md)
* [Matlab](matlab/intro.md)
* [R](r/intro.md)
* Javascript

For each of these languages, there is a library that provides all of the necessary functions.  These enable you to generate **everything** that plot.ly is capable of generating, using your **native** programming language, **without any connection to the internet** or any online service, and with **complete privacy**.

The plot.ly tools for each of the languages are dealt with separately in this course.  The items in the list above are linked to the relevant sections.
