# Purely Web-based plotting (or how you'll learn to love making websites!)


## Why?



Sooo ... why would you make things hard for yourself?  When you can python away or hack away in Matlab or RStudio, why would we turn our data visualisation problem into a "learning to make a web page" problem?  Geek masochism? Perhaps.  The real answer though is far more intimidating ... power!  Like force lightening power.

## How much power?

**First, Plotly is universal.**  
Before diving in, recall the [universality of Plotly](README.md). The Plotly side of things is essentially the same as what you would have learnt using Plotly with python/Matlab/R.  Plotly works the same way and with the same logic using javascript as with the other programming languages.

**Second, making your own web page is much more within your grasp than you realise.**
The basics of make a web page with some text, pictures and getting it online, is really quite easy and straight forward.  When it comes to getting some advanced interatcivity going, the required programming skill is the same as what you have for your data analysis in python/R/Matlab.
