# HTML

## Basic Introduction â€” what is an HTML?

HTML stands for *HyperText Markup Language*.  A nearly meaningless acronym that you can never use again ... saying 'HTML' is fine.

What it really means is that instead of clicking a bold button in MS Word to make text boldfaced, or clicking *insert > picture* from the menus to add a picture, you use some text to describe what you want.  

It's not programming.  It's formatting a document not with clicks but with descriptive text.  A heading, paragraph and picture, for instance, would be:

```HTML
<h1>This is the First Heading</h1>

<p style='font-size: 20'>This is a paragraph of text, to introduce the image that will be set up below</p>

<img src="my_rad_picture.jpg">
```

## What's involved

We will cover the the following:
* Making HTML *elements* with *tags*.
* Putting together a complete HTML document
* Adding some styling to our document.


## Elements

* tags
  * Main tags
* structure of a web page
